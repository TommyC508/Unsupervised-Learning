# Prompts and Project Process

This document collects the user's original prompts, the chronological actions taken, artifacts produced, how to reproduce the analysis, key results, and recommended next steps. It is intended as a compact project journal you can keep in the repository.

---

## 1) User prompts (chronological, paraphrased)
- "With the data given, give me a K-means cluster graph using unsupervised learning."
- "Add 3 centroids instead of 2 centers." 
- "Cast shaded bounds in the background for each categorization." 
- "Add another graph but instead of PCA1 and PCA2 use actual features in the dataset." 
- "Make more graphs of other features." 
- "Put the KMeans graph and code into a new folder and create another folder for an unsupervised learning method called DBSCAN." 
- "Where are my graphs for DBSCAN?" and "Tell me about the DBSCAN clusters." 
- "Produce a k-distance plot and re-run DBSCAN on a smaller feature subset automatically." 
- "How can you improve K-means accuracy?" and "Do your recommended changes and put it in another folder called 'kmeans_improved'."
- "Explain how the improved one has or does not have better accuracy." 
- "Explain the KMeans graph to me and provide insights that can be deducted about the data from the graphs." 
- "Compare the height and weight." 
- "Can you create another file to put my previous prompts inside and how the project was done?"

## 2) What I implemented (timeline & artifacts)
- Initial exploratory KMeans prototype (script): `kmeans_clustering.py` (root and a copy in `kmeans/`).
  - Produced: elbow, silhouette diagnostics, PCA scatter with shaded decision regions, feature-pair cluster plots, `gym_members_with_clusters.csv`, `centroids_k3.csv`.
- Visual improvements: shaded decision-region background by predicting a dense PCA grid and plotting contourf.
- Feature-pair plots: additional scatter plots on actual feature axes (e.g., BMI vs Calories_Burned) with decision-region background.
- Project organization: created `kmeans/` for KMeans artifacts and `dbscan/` for DBSCAN experiments.
- DBSCAN experiments: starter script and a parameter sweep script that produced `dbscan_param_search.csv` and heatmaps showing cluster counts and % noise across parameter grids.
- Improved KMeans pipeline (folder `kmeans_improved/`): implemented the recommended preprocessing and robust KMeans settings:
  - Winsorization (clip 0.5% tails) per feature.
  - Log1p transform for `Calories_Burned`.
  - `RobustScaler` instead of `StandardScaler`.
  - Focused feature subset: `['BMI','Calories_Burned','Session_Duration (hours)','Workout_Frequency (days/week)','Fat_Percentage','Experience_Level']`.
  - K-range 2..6, `n_init=50`.
  - Diagnostics saved to `kmeans_improved/kmeans_improved_results.csv` and plots (`elbow.png`, `silhouette.png`, `kmeans_pca.png`, `kmeans_BMI_vs_Calories_Burned.png`).
  - Labeled CSV: `kmeans_improved/gym_members_with_clusters_improved.csv` and centroid CSVs like `centroids_k2_improved.csv`.

---

## 3) Key results (selected numbers)
- Baseline KMeans (StandardScaler, all numeric features) k=2:
  - silhouette ≈ 0.245, Calinski–Harabasz ≈ 271.7, Davies–Bouldin ≈ 1.417.
  - cluster sizes: 198 and 775.
- Improved KMeans (winsorize, log1p, RobustScaler, focused features) k=2:
  - silhouette ≈ 0.431, Calinski–Harabasz ≈ 717.5, Davies–Bouldin ≈ 0.7703.
  - cluster sizes: 198 and 775 (same counts in this run).
  - Adjusted Rand Index between baseline k=2 and improved k=2 ≈ 0.90 (labels are highly similar; preprocessing sharpened separation).

Per-cluster behavioral patterns (improved clustering):
- Cluster 0 (198 members): higher calories burned (~1263), longer sessions (~1.75 h), higher frequency (~4.5 days/wk), lower fat% (~15%), higher experience.
- Cluster 1 (775 members): lower calories (~814), shorter sessions (~1.13 h), lower frequency (~3 days/wk), higher fat% (~27.5%), lower experience.

Height & Weight comparison (improved clusters):
- No meaningful difference between clusters (means nearly identical): weight mean ~74.0 vs 73.8 kg (p ≈ 0.88), height ~1.725 vs 1.722 m (p ≈ 0.79). Cohen's d small.
- Interpretation: clusters are behavioral (intensity/frequency/experience), not anthropometric.

## 4) Files created (high level)
- `kmeans_clustering.py` (original prototype)
- `kmeans/` folder: KMeans scripts, plots, `gym_members_with_clusters.csv`, `centroids_k3.csv`.
- `dbscan/` folder: `dbscan_clustering.py`, `dbscan_param_search.py`, parameter sweep CSV and heatmaps.
- `kmeans_improved/` folder: `kmeans_improved.py`, `README.md`, `kmeans_improved_results.csv`, `gym_members_with_clusters_improved.csv`, `centroids_k2_improved.csv`, `elbow.png`, `silhouette.png`, `kmeans_pca.png`, `kmeans_BMI_vs_Calories_Burned.png`.
- `PROMPTS_AND_PROCESS.md` (this file).

## 5) How to reproduce the main runs
(Assumes Python 3 and dependencies: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.)

Run the improved pipeline (will write CSVs and plots to `kmeans_improved/`):

```bash
python3 kmeans_improved/kmeans_improved.py
```

Run the original baseline KMeans diagnostic snippet (quick check used during analysis):

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
# small snippet: standardize numeric, fit KMeans for k=2..6 and print metrics
# (see earlier scripts in repository for the full code)
PY
```

Notes: Many scripts save outputs to the `kmeans/`, `dbscan/`, and `kmeans_improved/` folders. See those folders for plots and CSVs.

## 6) Limitations and suggested next steps
- Limitations:
  - No ground-truth labels — unsupervised clusters are descriptive.
  - Results depend on chosen features & transforms; different choices may reveal other structure.
  - Time dynamics not modeled (clusters are static snapshots).

- Suggested next steps:
  1. Run clustering stability tests (bootstrap ARI across repeated KMeans fits).
  2. Compare with alternative methods (GaussianMixture, KMedoids, HDBSCAN).
  3. Re-run improved pipeline forcing `k=3` if you need 3 segments for business reasons.
  4. Add CLI flags to `kmeans_improved.py` for reproducibility and parameter tuning.

---

## 7) Where outputs live
- `kmeans/` — baseline KMeans scripts and artifacts
- `dbscan/` — DBSCAN scripts and param-sweep outputs
- `kmeans_improved/` — improved preprocessing KMeans outputs (CSV, centroids, plots)

---

If you want, I can also:
- Add this file to `README.md` as a link, or
- Generate a short one-page PDF segment brief per cluster (demographics + suggested interventions), or
- Force-run the improved pipeline with k=3 and write the results to `kmeans_improved/centroids_k3_improved.csv` and `gym_members_with_clusters_k3_improved.csv`.

Tell me which of those (if any) you'd like next.
