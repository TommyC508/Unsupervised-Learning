Some Key numeric insights:
- The BMI 24.97 to 24.90, both clusters have similar BMI
- Cluster 0 has 1.747h long sessions on average compared to 
  cluster 1 having 1.131h sessions which may explain why cluster 
  0 also has 1262.6 calories burned on average compared to 814.2
  for cluster 1. 
    - this is logical since people who worked out more burned more calories

- Cluster 0 works out 4.52 days/week which compared to cluster 1's
  3.02 days/week is pretty significant. This may explain why cluster 0
  has a 15.04% average body fat compared to cluster 1's 27.52%

  - This is also logical as people who worked out more often had lower
    body fat

- Cluster 0 has almost double cluster 1's experience level which is as expected

- One question I have is that why is cluster 0's BMI similar with cluster 1's
  whilst both clusters have a 12% difference in body fat. BMI is calculated with
  height and weight so people with more fat usually have higher BMI.
  - One possible answer I thought of is that cluster 0 either have equivalent
    amount of lean muscle weight to make up for the fat, or the height of the two
    may be the other factor affecting it.

  - However, after comparing the means of height in both clusters, they
    were found to be similar, as is the mean of the weight. This means it is very possible
    that the cluster 0 has enough lean muscle to make up for the weight of the fat
    for cluster 1



Why K-Means 2 cluster worked best:

This method produced the highest accuracy by having the highest average point-to-cluster fit
Also the the clusters were more compact and well-separated from other clusters

This created a distinct expert vs. beginner difference to show how and which features make people experts and which don't matter
