This folder contains the KMeans implementation and outputs.

Files:
- `kmeans_clustering.py` — script that runs KMeans on the numeric features, produces diagnostics, saves `gym_members_with_clusters.csv`, `centroids_k3.csv`, and multiple cluster plots.
- `requirements.txt` — project dependencies (also at the repo root).

Run:

```bash
cd kmeans
python3 kmeans_clustering.py
```

Outputs are saved in this folder when you run the script from within it.
